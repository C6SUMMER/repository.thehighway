I'm aware that GoodDrama isn't anime, but it was a simular site linked to by one or more of the others... so I tossed it into the plugin as well for you jdrama fans. I'm still learning with it comes to python and having the most basic of flaws throw trouble at me, so there's bound to be some features lacking as well as some extra code left in at times that may not have gotten cleaned up at release time.</description>

    <description lang="en">This addon is now a fun little project to learn from and work on building a tool of my own for providing use of tools, fixes and the such, as well as, making available common repositories and examples of doing sub-addons, including many of my own and some example ones for other addons you might like to try...  This plugin is was to be a remake of TheAnime[COLOR tan]Highway[/COLOR] (plugin.video.theanimehighway).  It is my hope to make some improvements apon my original addon and make it a bit easier to add new handled sites and go back in to make fixes.

  	<description>Graphics by Surfer.  This is basically a service project to handle the running of a nice FTP Server I found code for, as noted in the changelog.txt.  This is ment to eventually be for quick and easy use of even semi-newb-users, but for now is mainly meant for Advanced Users, until things get weeded out and more people come to understand how it works.
